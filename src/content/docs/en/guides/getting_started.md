## Precautions & Disclaimer
* * *
EAUploader is developed and provided as OSS (Open Source Software). It is not a product.
Project EAUploader (uslog.tech) is not responsible for any damages that may occur as a result of using EAUploader.

Unity has various bugs. Occasionally, unpredictable, unresolved bugs or crashes may occur. In the worst case, the project may fail to launch (the project may break).
Please make sure to back up your projects.
Also, please save important data such as avatar data outside of the project.

## Description of What to Install
* * *
### Software to Install

**ãƒ»Unity Hub**
- A software to manage Unity.
  (Since Unity has many versions, each acting as independent software, Unity Hub manages and authenticates licenses for Unity.)

**ãƒ»Unity Editor**
- The main body of Unity. However, in this guide, it will be installed automatically using the following Creator Companion.

**ãƒ»Creator Companion**
- A Unity project management software distributed by VRChat.
  Commonly known as VCC.

**Packages to Install (Additional features and tools to install in Unity)**

**ãƒ»VRCSDK**
- A package distributed by VRChat for creating, editing, and uploading avatars and worlds. It is automatically added to projects created with VCC.

**ãƒ»EAUploader**
- The main body of EAUploader. It operates within Unity.

Operations in EAUploader make changes in Unity. Unity does not save changes automatically to maintain the usual work state.
  Uploading avatars through EAUploader uses the features of VRCSDK and is the same as uploading using VRCSDK.
