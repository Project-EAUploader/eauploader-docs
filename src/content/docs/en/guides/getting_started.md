## Notes and Disclaimers

EAUploader is an open-source software tool developed and provided by Project EAUploader (uslog.tech). It is not a commercial product.
Project EAUploader (uslog.tech) is not responsible for any damages caused by the use of EAUploader.

Unity has various bugs. Occasionally, unexpected and unsolvable bugs or crashes may occur. In the worst case, the project may become unlaunchable (project corruption).
Please make sure to back up your project (refer to the section "How to Back Up After Installation" on this page).
Also, please save important data such as avatar data outside of the project.

## Description of Installation Contents

### Software to Install

**- Unity Hub**
- Software for managing Unity (Unity has multiple versions, each being an independent software. Unity Hub is used to manage and authenticate licenses for Unity)

**- Unity Editor**
- The main Unity software. However, in this guide, we will use Creator Companion for automatic installation.

**- Creator Companion**
- Unity project management software distributed by VRChat. It is commonly referred to as VCC.

**Packages to Install (Additional Features/Tools to Install in Unity)**

**- VRCSDK**
- A package distributed by VRChat for creating, editing, and uploading avatars and worlds. It is automatically added to projects created with VCC.

**- EAUploader**
- The main EAUploader software. It runs on Unity.

Operations in EAUploader involve making changes to Unity. Unity normally maintains the working state, so it does not perform save operations when exiting.
Uploading avatars with EAUploader uses the functionality of VRCSDK, so it is the same as uploading with VRCSDK.
